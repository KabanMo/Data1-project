This project extracts the top 50 songs from UK, US,AUS, SA, INDIA, and globally from spotify API and analyses it using matoplotlib ...  to determine whether there are differences/similarites in the music tastes of these 5 countries. 

Our results can be used to help music industry professionals decide where their music may be most popular. They could also be used by streaming services to recommend music that is more likely to be suited to individuals based on their location.
