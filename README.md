This project extracts the top 50 songs from UK🇬🇧, US🇺🇸, AUS🇦🇺, SA🇿🇦, INDIA🇮🇳, and globally🌍 from [Spotify API](https://api.spotify.com/v1/), and we look at the differences and similarities among the features of these tracks.

## 🔧Methods
To perform our analysis, we utilised Jupyter Notebook, along with popular Python libraries such as `numpy`,`json`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `WordCloud`, `SciPy`, `math`, `statistics` and `seaborn`. 

## 🎯Target Audience
Our results can be used to help music industry professionals decide where their music may be most popular. They could also be used by streaming services to recommend music that is more likely to be suited to individuals based on their location.
