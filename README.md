This project extracts the top 50 songs from UK🇬🇧, US🇺🇸, AUS🇦🇺, SA🇿🇦, INDIA🇮🇳, and globally🌍 from Spotify API. 

To perform our analysis, we utilised Jupyter Notebook, along with popular Python libraries such as `json`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. 

Our results can be used to help music industry professionals decide where their music may be most popular. They could also be used by streaming services to recommend music that is more likely to be suited to individuals based on their location. 

If you wish to contribute to our project then please contact us on GitHub. We would love to hear your insights and opinions.
